					Introduction</h2> 
                		<p> The contrast sensitivity tool evaluates the monocular and/or binocular contrast perception on head-mounted display (HMD).  
					Contrast sensitivity response (CSR), as the reciprocol of the threshold (minimum detectable) contrast of the human participant, is measured at various spatial frequencies. 
					This is achieved using a 2D sinusoidal pattern with predefined contrast and spatial frequency, known as a Gabor target. 
					The Gabor target can be rendered at a single or multiple locations across the display field of view (FOV). 
					The tool ensures that the sinusoidal contrast pattern remains circular (or perpendicular to the radial direction) relative to the target location. This orientation effectively captures contrast degradation caused by optical aberrations on VR HMDs.

			</section id = "Experiment">
			<h2> Experiment </h2>
			<p> In the experiment, the location, size, spatial frequency range, and background noise of the Gabor target should be determined in the setup stage with detailed instructions below. 
				During the perceptual experiments, the setup parameters cannot be changed. 
				Each experiment contains multiple trails to determine the threshold contrast of the Gabor target at various spatial frequencies. In each trial, the target's contrast (starting as gray difference of 10, correponding to a contrast of about 0.04) can be incremented or decremented by adjusting the display gray level using a headset controller (thumbstick up or down) or Bluetooth keyboard (arrow up or down) until reaching the threshold contrast of each trial. 
				Once the threshold contrast is obtained, press button "A" on the controller or keyboard to complete the current trial. For very poor image quality conditions, e.g., threshold contrast close to 1, the button "B" can be used to maximize the contrast to 1 for further adjustment. 
				At the end of the experiment, all trial data is saved as a JSON file. Statistical analysis of the results measured on mulitple human participants is applied to obtain the CSR of a group of participants.

				<h2>Setup</h2>
				<p> Prior to the experiment, the testing conditions should be setup in the menu on the left hand side of the user interface using a compatible HMD controller or Bluetooth keyboard.
					The experiment will run from the minimum frequency to maximum frequency over a fixed position at the center of FOV or 9 different positions across FOV. When the experiment is set to run over 9 locations, the first trial (trial 0) is for illustration and practice, which will be excluded in the data processing. 
					The "min frequency", "max frequency" and "step frequency" are measured in cycles per degree. 
					"Size" is the standard deviation of the gaussian bracket of the Garbor target measured in meters that determines the target dimension. Note that the depth of the target is fixed at a long distance of 150 m. "Shift" is the shortest distance in meters between targets over 9 positions. The background noise checkbox opens the noise menu which allows the user to adjust the noise amplitude in gray levels and standard deviation of the noise kernel.
					Below is detailed information on the units associated with each value in the menu.</p>

					<li><strong>Max Frequency: </strong>Spatial frequency of the patch when the experiment ends. Max value is 6 due to headset antialiasing. </b></li>
					<li><strong>Step Frequency: </strong>Spatial frequency to increment the patch by. Value must be between min and max frequency. </b></li>
					<li><strong>Shift: </strong>The distance between targets in terms of meters based on the WebXR documentation. </b></li>

	<a class="button" href="https://github.com/Khushibhansali/WebXR-contrast-sensitivity-tool/blob/main/tool/AnalyzeJsonResults.ipynb" target="_blank">View Python Code to Plot JSON Results</a>
             <p>This code is designed to analyze and visualize contrast sensitivity data from multiple experiments. Its main functions are:</p>
	    <ul>
		<li><strong>Data Processing:</strong> It processes multiple JSON files containing experimental results on contrast sensitivity.</li>
		<li><strong>Data Aggregation:</strong> The code combines data from all input files and calculates average contrast sensitivity for each spatial frequency and position combination.</li>
		<li><strong>Visualization:</strong> It generates a set of plots (up to 9) showing the Contrast Sensitivity Function (CSF) for different positions in the visual field.</li>
	    </ul>

	<h3>To use this code effectively:</h3>
	    <ol>
	        <li><strong>Prepare Your Data:</strong> Ensure your JSON files follow the structure shown above.</li>
	        <li><strong>Set the Folder Path:</strong> Replace the <code>folder_path</code> variable with the path to your folder containing the JSON files from your experiments.</li>
	        <pre><code>folder_path = '/path/to/your/folder'</code></pre>
	        <li><strong>Run the Script:</strong> Execute the script after setting the correct folder path.</li>
	        <li><strong>Interpret the Results:</strong> The script will generate a figure with up to 9 subplots, each representing a different position in the visual field. These plots show how contrast sensitivity changes with spatial frequency for each position.</li>
	    </ol>
	
		<br/><br/><br/>
	    <h3>What the Plots Show</h3>
	    <ul>
	        <li><strong>X-axis:</strong> Spatial Frequency (cycles/degree) - derived from the "frequency" field in each response</li>
	        <li><strong>Y-axis:</strong> Contrast Sensitivity Function (CSF) on a logarithmic scale - calculated as 1/contrast</li>
	        <li>Each plot represents a different position in the visual field, based on the "position" array in each response</li>
	        <li>The line in each plot shows the average contrast sensitivity across all processed files for that position</li>
	        <li>Error bars (if included) represent standard error or standard deviation across multiple trials or participants</li>
	    </ul>
